By descending priority:
* fix: JS error when new lines (return) in text
* show: number of active rules instead just the number of rules
* (requires help) fix rules, like hace is transformed to aje due to rule for "ac"
* (optional) provide each rule with an example (does it add value? .. it should be hidden in mobile view when space is scarce)
* (optional) allow custom rule (s1->i1, s2->i2, ...) to facilitate updates (requires local storage)
* (optional) add feedback form
* (optional) preserve space, especially new lines
* (optional) persist rule selection (local storage)
* (optional) use more complete dictionary, e.g. http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/index.php/node/12
