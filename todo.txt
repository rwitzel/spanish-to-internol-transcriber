By priority:
* improve layout
* add section "background" with link to book and to rwitzel GitHub account
* remove falsely classified words from nouns list, like "a", "una", "grande" etc., e.g. when they can be both
  noun and adjective
* fix rules, like hace is transformed to aje due to rule for "ac"
* (optional) provide each rule with an example (does it add value? .. it should be hidden in mobile view when space is scarce)
