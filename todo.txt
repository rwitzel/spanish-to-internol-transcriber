By descending priority:
* (requires help) fix rule implementation, like hace is transformed to aje due to rule for "ac"
* (requires help) deal with ambiguous nouns, like "este"
* (requires help) deal with more special plural form like mujeres

Nice to have:
* preserve HTML markup (when text copied from another website)
* provide each rule with an example (does it add value? .. it should be hidden in mobile view when space is scarce)
* allow custom rule (s1->i1, s2->i2, ...) to facilitate updates (requires local storage)
* add feedback form
* persist rule selection (local storage)
* allow copy of internol text (clipboard)
* allow print of internol text
* use more complete dictionary, e.g. http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/index.php/node/12
  mentions 555,000 forms ("76.000 lemma-PoS combinations") (is this WordNet 3.0 as ILI?)
* internationalize the UI, e.g. via interpolation provider, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12923521/angular-js-custom-delimiter

Uppercase-only version:
* name with sustantivos enmayusculizados (definitely not capitalizar!)
* i18n texts to Spanish only (no longer English)
* show only unambiguous nouns, i.e. ignore adjectives
* (rejected) mark ambiguous nouns

Nice to have:
* show editor for resolving ambiguous nouns
* add feedback form resp. ask to create issue in github (hmm, requires github account which is cumbersome!)
