By priority:
* remove and move "falsely" classified words from nouns list, like "a", "una", "grande" etc., e.g. when they can be both
  noun and adjective to a new rule "uppercase for 'maybe' nouns"
* (requires help) fix rules, like hace is transformed to aje due to rule for "ac"
* (optional) provide each rule with an example (does it add value? .. it should be hidden in mobile view when space is scarce)
