By descending priority:
* (requires help) fix rule implementation, like hace is transformed to aje due to rule for "ac"
* (requires help) deal with ambiguous nouns, like "este"
* (requires help) deal with more special plural form like mujeres

Nice to have:
* preserve HTML markup (when text copied from another website)
* provide each rule with an example (does it add value? .. it should be hidden in mobile view when space is scarce)
* allow custom rule (s1->i1, s2->i2, ...) to facilitate updates (requires local storage)
* add feedback form
* persist rule selection (local storage)
* allow copy of internol text (clipboard)
* allow print of internol text
* use more complete dictionary, e.g. http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/index.php/node/12
